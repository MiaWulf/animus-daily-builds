# Welcome to Animus!

Animus is an **ADULT ONLY** role-playing game with anthropomorphic characters. This software is in active development by Studio E-Wulf and MiaWulf, and at the moment, comes in small pre-release builds that may or may not crash, be full of bugs, or just not boot. These are the daily builds, sorry about that ¯\\___(ツ)___/¯.

This software is Non-Free (Unity), and also protected by copyright.


# Files

Animus' game files come in Windows X86_64 (64 bit), are compressed into .tar files, and should be extractable via any mainstream archiving tool. Mia prefers WinZip for Windows, and tar for GNU/Linux and Mac OSX. Not sure how well Animus would run under the WiNE system, but their Windows API to POSIX API translation is getting better with every release.

Later on, Animus will be available on Windows X96_64, GNU/Linux via .deb and .tar, and Mac OSX via .PKG.

The game will also be available through the Itch.io launcher as it uses butler to push builds directly to players, but even that will one day be replaced by Animus' own launcher.
